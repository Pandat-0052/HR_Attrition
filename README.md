# <p align ="center"> HR Attrition Dashboard Project

## Overview
Welcome to my HR Attrition Dashboard project! In this project, I've developed a comprehensive dashboard using Excel to analyze and understand employee turnover trends within the organization. This dashboard provides valuable insights into attrition rates, demographic breakdowns, and education-related attrition patterns.

## Key Highlights
Here are some key highlights and insights from the dashboard:

- **Attrition Trends:** We observed a 16% increase in attrition rates over the past year, with notable trends in the sales executive and research scientist roles.
  
- **Demographic Insights:** Employees in the 26-35 age bracket show the highest attrition rates, emphasizing the need for targeted retention strategies.
  
- **Education Insights:** Employees with a Bachelor's degree have a higher attrition rate compared to other education levels, indicating specific challenges and areas for improvement.

## Retention Strategies
To address the challenges identified in attrition trends, we are implementing targeted retention strategies such as:
- Career development programs for employees with Bachelor's degrees.
- Flexible work arrangements to improve work-life balance.
- Recognition and rewards programs to boost morale and job satisfaction.
